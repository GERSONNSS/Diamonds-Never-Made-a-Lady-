Oh, my heart is crying in the night for you <P>
Oh, my God, oh, don't you feel like a fool? <BR>
You're foolin' yourself with a millionaire<BR>
You think it's love but he don't care<BR>
And one of these days you're gonna be surprised<BR>
Diamonds never made a lady, lover or a friend<BR>
I know it<BR>
Diamonds never made a lady, all your dreams will end<AUDIO CONTROLS><SOURCE SCR="https://github.com/GERSONNSS/Diamonds-Never-Made-a-Lady-/blob/main/Diamonds%20Never%20Made%20a%20Lady.mp3"TYPE="AUDIO/MPEG"></AUDIO><BR>                                                                                      
I know it<BR>
Your Californian nights<BR>
Warm body held you tight was just a dream<BR>
But all the diamond lights<BR>
Can't give you peaceful nights or sweet dreams<BR>
Oh, my God, you really think you have it made<BR>
Your heart is won, with first class expenses paid<BR>
You drink champagne, eat caviar<BR>
A color TV in the back of your car<BR>
But one of these days you're gonna be surprised<BR>
Diamonds never made a lady, lover or a friend<BR>
I know it<BR>
Diamonds never made a lady, all your dreams will end<BR>
I know it<BR>
Your Californian nights<BR>
Warm body held you tight was just a dream<BR>
But all the diamond lights<BR>
Can't give you peaceful nights or sweet dreams<BR>
The Californian nights<BR>
Warm body held you tight was just a dream<BR>
But all the diamond lights<BR>
Can't give you peaceful nights or sweet dreams<BR>
The Californian nights<BR>
Warm body held you tight was just a dream...
